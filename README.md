[Thompson groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_groups) are an interesting mathematical object. 

Their generalization to n dimensions are also interesting, but not easy to deal with. This project provides a platform to play with the elements of the group - in particular, to visualize them (in dimension 1 and 2), do basic computations, and explore questions such as conjugacy and growth.

Algorithms and math background: see the
[poster about this project [PDF]](http://romankogan.net/math/slides_posters/nvTrees_Paris_2015_Poster.pdf).

For a general introduction to Thompson groups, see [CFP](http://people.math.binghamton.edu/matt/thompson/cfp.pdf). 
The program uses a notation compatible with the examples of that paper.
